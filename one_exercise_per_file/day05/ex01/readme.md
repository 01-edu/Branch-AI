# Exercise 1

The goal of this exercise is to learn to manipulate time series in Pandas.

1. Create a `Series` named `integer_series` from 1st January 2010 to 31 December 2020. At each date is associated the number of days since 1st January 2010. It starts with 0.

2. Using Pandas, compute a 7 days moving average. This transformation smooths the time series by removing small fluctuations. **without for loop**
