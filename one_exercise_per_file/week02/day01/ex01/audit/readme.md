##### The exercice is validated is all questions of the exercice are validated

##### The question 1 is validated if the output of the fitted model is:

    ```python
    LinearRegression(copy_X=True, fit_intercept=[[1], [2.1], [3]], n_jobs=None,
                    normalize=[[1], [2], [3]])
    ```

##### The question 2 is validated if the output is:

    ```python
    array([[3.96013289]])
    ```

##### The question 3 is validated if the output is:

    ```output
    Coefficients:  [[0.99667774]]
    Intercept:  [-0.02657807]
    Score:  0.9966777408637874
    ```
