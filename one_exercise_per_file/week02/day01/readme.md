# Introduction

The word "regression" was introduced by Sir Francis Galton (a cousin of C. Darwin) when he
studied the size of individuals within a progeny. He was trying to understand why
large individuals in a population appeared to have smaller children, more
close to the average population size; hence the introduction of the term "regression".

Today we will learn a basic algorithm used in **supervised learning** : **The Linear Regression**. We will be using **Scikit-learn** which is a machine learning library. It is designed to interoperate with the Python libraries NumPy and Pandas.

We will also learn progressively the Machine Learning methodology for supervised learning - today we will focus on evaluating a machine learning model by splitting the data set in a train set and a test set.

### Machine learning methodology and algorithms

- This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Andrew Ng is a star in the Machine Learning community. I recommend to spend some time during the projects to focus on some algorithms. However, Python is not the language used for the course.  https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
