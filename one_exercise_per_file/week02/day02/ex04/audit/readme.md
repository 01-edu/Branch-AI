1. This question is validated if X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test match this output:

```console
X_train:  
 [[ 1  2]
 [ 3  4]
 [ 5  6]
 [ 7  8]
 [ 9 10]
 [11 12]
 [13 14]
 [15 16]]


y_train:  
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]


X_test:  
 [[17 18]
 [19 20]]


y_test:  
 [1. 1.]
```

The proportion of class `1` is **0.125** in the train set and **1.** in the test set.

2. This question is validated if the proportion of class `1` is **0.3** for both sets.
