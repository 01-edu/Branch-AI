##### The question 1 is validated if the output is:

```console
Scores on validation sets: 
 [0.62433594 0.61648956 0.62486602 0.59891024 0.59284295 0.61307055
 0.54630341 0.60742976 0.60014575 0.59574508]

Mean of scores on validation sets: 
 0.60201392526743

Standard deviation of scores on validation sets: 
 0.0214983822773466

```

The model is consistent across folds: it is stable. That's a first sign that the model is not over-fitted. The average R2 is 60% that's a good start ! To be improved...
