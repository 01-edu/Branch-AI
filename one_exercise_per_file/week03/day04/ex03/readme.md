# Exercise 3 Tokenization

The goal of this exercise is to learn to tokenize as text. This step is important because it splits the text into token. A token could be a sentence or a word. 

```
text = """Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software."""

```
1. Tokenize this text using `sent_tokenize` from NLTK.

2. Tokenize this text using `word_tokenize` from NLTK.
