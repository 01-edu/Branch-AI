# Introduction

Deep learning is a huge domain. We will focus on Artificial Neural Networks. The goal is to understand how do the neural networks train and train them on data. Understand the challenges of training a neural network
Architectures as RNN, LSTM (learn sequences, used in TS and NLP),CNN used a lot in image processing are well know algorithms in deep learning but won't be covered by the AI branch. Once you have a good understanding of ANN feel free to extend your knowledge to new architectures.
