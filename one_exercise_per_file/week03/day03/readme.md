The goal of this day is to learn to use Keras to build Neural Networks and train them on small data sets.

## Historical



## Rules

The correction will provide the code and output because it is not straightforward to reproduce results using Keras. There are many source of randomness. Even if all the seeds are fixed to a constant they may be other source of randomness. https://machinelearningmastery.com/reproducible-results-neural-networks-keras/
