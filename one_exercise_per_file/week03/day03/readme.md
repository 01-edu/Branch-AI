## Keras 2

The goal of this day is to learn to use Keras to build Neural Networks and train them on small data sets. This helps to understand the specifics of networks for classification and regression. 

Note: 

The audit will provide the code and output because it is not straightforward to reproduce results using Keras. There are many source of randomness. Even if all the seeds are fixed to a constant they may be other source of randomness. https://machinelearningmastery.com/reproducible-results-neural-networks-keras/

## Exercises of the day

- Exercise 1 Regression - Optimize 
- Exercise 2 Regression example
- Exercise 3 Multi classification - Softmax
- Exercise 4 Multi classification - Optimize 
- Exercise 5 Multi classification example


## Virtual Environment 
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Jupyter or JupyterLab
- Keras

*Version of Keras I used to do the exercises: 2.4.3*. 
I suggest to use the most recent one.
