Keras backend TF
The goal of this day is to learn to use Keras to build Neural Networks. 

There are two ways to build Keras models: sequential and functional.

The sequential API allows you to create models layer-by-layer for most problems. It is limited in that it does not allow you to create models that share layers or have multiple inputs or outputs. The exercises focuses on the usage of the sequential API.

## Rules

The correction will provide the code and output because it is not straightforward to reproduce results using Keras. There are many source of randomness. Even if all the seeds are fixed to a constant they may be other source of randomness. https://machinelearningmastery.com/reproducible-results-neural-networks-keras/
