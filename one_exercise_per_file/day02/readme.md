# Introduction

The goal of this day is to understand practical usage of Pandas.
As Pandas in intensively used in Data Science, other days of the piscine will be dedicated to it.

Not only is the Pandas library a central component of the data science toolkit but it is used in conjunction with other libraries in that collection.

Pandas is built on top of the NumPy package, meaning a lot of the structure of NumPy is used or replicated in Pandas. Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in SciPy, plotting functions from Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.

Most of the topics we will cover today are explained and describes with examples in the first resource. The number of exercises is low on purpose: Take the time to understand the chapter 5 of the resource, even if there are 40 pages.

The version of Pandas I used is '1.0.1'.
