# Exercise 1 Your first NumPy array

The goal of this exercise is to use many Python data types in **NumPy** arrays. **NumPy** arrays are intensively used in **NumPy** and **Pandas**. They are flexible and allow to use optimized **NumPy** underlying functions.

1. Create a NumPy array that contains: an integer, a float, a string, a dictionary, a list, a tuple, a set and a boolean.

The expected output is:

```python
for i in your_np_array:
    print(type(i))

<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'dict'>
<class 'list'>
<class 'tuple'>
<class 'set'>
<class 'bool'>
```
