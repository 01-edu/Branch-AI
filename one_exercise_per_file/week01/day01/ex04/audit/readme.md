For this exercise, as the results may change depending on the version of the package or the OS, I give the code to correct the exercise. If the code is correct and the output is not the same as mine, it is accepted.

1. The solution is accepted if the solution is: `np.random.seed(888)`

2. The solution is accepted if the solution is `np.random.randn(100)`. The value of the first element is `0.17620087373662233`.

3. The solution is accepted if the solution is `np.random.randint(1,11,(8,8))`.

    ```console
    Given the NumPy version and the seed, you should have this output:

    array([[ 7,  4,  8, 10,  2,  1,  1, 10],
        [ 4,  1,  7,  4,  3,  5,  2,  8],
        [ 3,  9,  7,  4,  9,  6, 10,  5],
        [ 7, 10,  3, 10,  2,  1,  3,  7],
        [ 3,  2,  3,  2, 10,  9,  5,  4],
        [ 4,  1,  9,  7,  1,  4,  3,  5],
        [ 3,  2, 10,  8,  6,  3,  9,  4],
        [ 4,  4,  9,  2,  8,  5,  9,  5]])
    ```

4. The solution is accepted if the solution is `np.random.randint(1,18,(4,2,5))`.

    ```console
    Given the NumPy version and the seed, you should have this output:

    array([[[14, 16,  8, 15, 14],
            [17, 13,  1,  4, 17]],

        [[ 7, 15,  2,  8,  3],
            [ 9,  4, 13,  9, 15]],

        [[ 5, 11, 11, 14, 10],
            [ 2,  1, 15,  3,  3]],

        [[ 3, 10,  5, 16, 13],
            [17, 12,  9,  7, 16]]])
    ```
