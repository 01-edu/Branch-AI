##### The exercice is validated is all questions of the exercice are validated

##### The question 1 is validated if the generated array is based on an iterator as `range` or `np.arange`. Check that 50 is part of the array.

##### The question 2 is validated if the generated array is based on an iterator as `range` or `np.arange`. Check that 100 is part of the array.

##### The question 3 is validated if you concatenated this way `np.concatenate(array1,array2)`.

##### The question 4 is validated if the result is:

    ```console
    array([[  1,  ... ,  10],
                ...
        [ 91,  ... , 100]])
    ```

The easiest way is to use `array.reshape(10,10)`.
