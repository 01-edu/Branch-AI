## Exercise 3 Matplotlib 1

The goal of this plot is to learn to use Matplotlib to plot data. As you know, Matplotlib is the underlying library used by Pandas. It provides more options to plot custom visualizations. Howerver, most of the plots we will create with Matplotlib can be reproduced with Pandas' `.plot()`.

1. Reproduce this plot. We assume the data points have integers coordinates.
