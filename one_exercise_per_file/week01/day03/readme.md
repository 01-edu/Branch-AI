# Introduction

While working on a dataset it is important to check the distribution of the data. Obviously, for most of humans it is difficult to visualize the data in more than 3 dimensions

Viz is important to understand the data and to show results. We have already seen there are some basinc viz functionalities in Pandas.
Now we'll discover two of the most know viz libraries in Python:

- Pandas viz
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

Pandas viz is pratique: rapid plot, relies on Matplotlib. (check matplotlib doc sometimes not all params are detailed in pandas doc)
For more elaborate plots Matplotlib is necessary

And finaly Plotly is a interactive plot library.s
