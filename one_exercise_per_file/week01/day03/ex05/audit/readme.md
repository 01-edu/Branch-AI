##### The solution of question 1 is accepted if the plot reproduces the plot in the image and respect those criteria.

###### Does it contain 6 subplots (2 rows, 3 columns)? 
###### Does it have space between plots (`hspace=0.5` and `wspace=0.5`)?
###### Do all subplots contain a title: `Title i` ? 
###### Do all subplots contain a text `(2,3,i)` centered at `(0.5, 0.5)`? *Hint*: check the parameter `ha` of `text`
###### Have all subplots been created in a for loop ?
