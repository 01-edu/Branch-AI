# Exercise 6 Plotly 1

Plotly has evolved a lot in the previous years. It is important to **always check the documentation**.

Plotly comes with a high level interface: Plotly Express. It helps building some complex plots easily. The lesson won't detail the complex examples. Plotly express is quite interesting while using Pandas Dataframes because there are some built-in functions that leverage Pandas Dataframes.

The plot outputed by Plotly is interactive and can also be dynamic.

The goal of the exercise is to plot the price of a company. Its price is generated below.

```python
returns = np.random.randn(50)
price = 100 + np.cumsum(returns)

dates = pd.date_range(start='2020-09-01', periods=50, freq='B')
df = pd.DataFrame(zip(dates, price),
                  columns=['Date','Company_A'])
```

1. Using **Plotly express**, reproduce the plot in the image. As the data is generated randomly I do not expect you to reproduce the same line.

The plot has to contain:

- title
- x-axis name
- yaxis name

2. Same question but now using `plotly.graph_objects`. You may need to use `init_notebook_mode` from `plotly.offline`.
