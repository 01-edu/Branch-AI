## Time Series with Pandas

Time series data are data that are indexed by a sequence of dates or times. Today, you'll learn how to use methods built into Pandas to work with this index. You'll also learn for instance:
- to resample time series to change the frequency
- to calculate rolling and cumulative values for times series
-  to build a backtest

Time series a used A LOT in finance. You'll learn to evaluate financial strategies using Pandas. It is important to keep in mind that Python is vectorized. That's why some questions constraint you to not use a for loop ;-).

## Exercises of the day

- Exercise 1 Series
- Exercise 2 Financial data
- Exercise 3 Multi asset returns
- Exercise 4 Backtest


## Virtual Environment 
- Python 3.x

*Version of Pandas I used to do the exercises: 1.0.1*. 
I suggest to use the most recent one.
