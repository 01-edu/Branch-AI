##### The exercice is validated is all questions of the exercice are validated

##### For this exercise, as the results may change depending on the version of the package or the OS, I give the code to correct the exercise. If the code is correct and the output is not the same as mine, it is accepted.

##### The question 1 is validated if the solution is: `np.random.seed(888)`

##### The question 2 is validated if the solution is: `np.random.randn(100)`. The value of the first element is `0.17620087373662233`.

##### The question 3 is validated if the solution is: `np.random.randint(1,11,(8,8))`.

    ```console
    Given the NumPy version and the seed, you should have this output:

    array([[ 7,  4,  8, 10,  2,  1,  1, 10],
        [ 4,  1,  7,  4,  3,  5,  2,  8],
        [ 3,  9,  7,  4,  9,  6, 10,  5],
        [ 7, 10,  3, 10,  2,  1,  3,  7],
        [ 3,  2,  3,  2, 10,  9,  5,  4],
        [ 4,  1,  9,  7,  1,  4,  3,  5],
        [ 3,  2, 10,  8,  6,  3,  9,  4],
        [ 4,  4,  9,  2,  8,  5,  9,  5]])
    ```

##### The question 4 is validated if the solution is: `np.random.randint(1,18,(4,2,5))`.

    ```console
    Given the NumPy version and the seed, you should have this output:

    array([[[14, 16,  8, 15, 14],
            [17, 13,  1,  4, 17]],

        [[ 7, 15,  2,  8,  3],
            [ 9,  4, 13,  9, 15]],

        [[ 5, 11, 11, 14, 10],
            [ 2,  1, 15,  3,  3]],

        [[ 3, 10,  5, 16, 13],
            [17, 12,  9,  7, 16]]])
    ```
