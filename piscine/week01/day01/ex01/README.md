# Exercise 1 Your first NumPy array

The goal of this exercise is to use many Python data types in **NumPy** arrays. **NumPy** arrays are intensively used in **NumPy** and **Pandas**. They are flexible and allow to use optimized **NumPy** underlying functions.

1. Create a NumPy array that contains: an integer, a float, a string, a dictionary, a list, a tuple, a set and a boolean. Add the following code at the end of your python file or in a cell of the jupyter notebook: 

```python
for i in your_np_array:
    print(type(i))
```
