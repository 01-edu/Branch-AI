# Exercise 6 Part-of-speech tags 

The goal od this exercise is to learn to use the Part-of-speech tags (**POS TAG**) using Spacy. As explained in wikipedia, the POS TAG is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context.

Example

The sentence: **"Heat water in a large vessel"** is tagged this way after the POS TAG: 
- heat verb (noun)
- water noun (verb)
- in prep (noun, adv)
- a det (noun)
- large adj (noun)
- vessel noun


The data `news_amazon.txt` used is a news paper about Amazon. 

1. Return all sentences mentioning **Bezos** as a NNP (tag).
