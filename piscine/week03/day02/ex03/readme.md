# Exercise 3 Architecture

The goal of this exercise is to combine the layers and to create a neural network. 

1. Create a neural network for regression with the following architecture and return `print(model.summary())`: 

    - 5 inputs variables
    - hidden layer 1: 8 neurons and sigmoid as activation function
    - hidden layer 2: 4 neurons and sigmoid as activation function
    - output layer: 1 neuron. Find the adapted activation function
