##### The exercice is validated is all questions of the exercice are validated

##### The question 1 is validated if the outputted plot looks like:

[ex5q1]: ../w2_day1_ex5_q1.png "Scatter plot "

##### The question 2 is validated if the output is: `11808.867339751561`

##### The question 3 is validated if `grid.shape` is `(640000,2)`.

##### The question 4 is validated if the 10 first values of losses are:

```console
array([158315.41493175, 158001.96852692, 157689.02212209, 157376.57571726,

    155821.84369312, 155512.39728829])
```

##### The question 5 is validated if the outputted plot looks like
