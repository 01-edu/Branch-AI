# Exercise 1 Scikit-learn estimator

The goal of this exercise is to learn to fit a Scikit-learn estimator and use it to predict.

```console
X, y = [[1],[2.1],[3]], [[1],[2],[3]]
```

1. Fit a LinearRegression from Scikit-learn with X the features and y the target and predict for `x_pred = [[4]]`

2. Print the coefficients (`coefs_`) and the intercept (`intercept_`), the score (`score`) of the regression of X and y.
