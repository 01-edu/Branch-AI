##### The exercice is validated is all questions of the exercice are validated

##### The question 1 is validated if the scaled train set is as below. And by definition, the mean on the axis 0 should be `array([0., 0., 0.])` and the standard deviation on the axis 0 should be `array([1., 1., 1.])`.

```console
array([[ 0.        , -1.22474487,  1.33630621],
       [ 1.22474487,  0.        , -0.26726124],
       [-1.22474487,  1.22474487, -1.06904497]])
```

##### The question 2 is validated if the scaled test set is:

```console
array([[ 1.22474487, -1.22474487,  0.53452248],
       [ 2.44948974,  3.67423461, -1.06904497],
       [ 0.        ,  1.22474487,  0.53452248]])
```
