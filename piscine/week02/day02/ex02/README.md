# Exercise 2 Sigmoid

The goal of this exercise is to learn to compute and plot the sigmoid function.

1. On the same plot, plot the sigmoid function and the custom sigmoids defined as:

- `sigmoid1(x) = 1/(1+ exp(-(0.5*x + 3)))`

- `sigmoid2(x) = 1/(1+ exp(-(5*x + 11)))`

- Add a line representing the probability=0.5

The plot should look like this:
