# Exercise 1 Logistic regression in Scikit-learn

The goal of this exercise is to learn to use Scikit-learn to classify data.

```python
X = [[0],[0.1],[0.2], [1],[1.1],[1.2], [1.3]]
y = [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]
```

1. Predict the class for `x_pred = [[0.5]]`.

2. Predict the probabilities for `x_pred = [[0.5]]` using `predict_proba`.

3. Print the coefficients (`coef_`), the intercept (`intercept_`) and the score of the logistic regression of X and y.
